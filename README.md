# Maze-Generator
Maze Generation Project created using pygame. The generation for the maze takes inspirations from the DFS algorithm. 
Starting at the top left corner, it generates a maze with exit being the bottom right corner.
This was project was created so that I can learn how pygame graphics work and brush up on python.
